    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This no-bake millionaire's shortbread has a buttery, tender base followed by a layer of homemade melt-in-your mouth caramel and topped with dark chocolate. Sprinkle with sea salt to cut the sweetness if you like.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces shortbread cookies</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li> 6 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>10 ounces dark chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Grease a 9x9-inch square baking pan and line with parchment paper so parchment paper overhangs edges by 1-inch.</li>
            <li>Pulse cookies in a food processor until fine crumbs form.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt 1/2 cup butter and add to the cookie crumbs in the food processor; pulse until combined. </li>
            <li>Press crumb mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking pan using the flat bottom of a measuring cup or glass. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine 6 tablespoons butter, sweetened condensed milk, brown sugar, and salt in a saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until boiling, stirring often. </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring continuously, until a candy thermometer reads 230 to 235 degrees F (110 to 113 degrees C) or until thickened and darkened in color, 6 to 8 minutes. Pour caramel over the chilled shortbread base and spread evenly. Refrigerate for 2 hours. </li>
            <li>Once caramel has chilled, combine dark chocolate chips and remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave safe bowl. </li>
            <li>Microwave chocolate on High until melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring every 20 seconds. Spread melted chocolate mixture evenly over the chilled caramel layer.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with coarse sea salt after standing for 10 minutes, if desired. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. </li>
            <li>Remove from the pan, place on a cutting board, and let stand for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut into 24 bars.</li>
        </ol>
